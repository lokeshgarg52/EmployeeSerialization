# Employee Serialization (Java Project)

This project demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize Java objects using the `Serializable` interface.  
It is implemented with a simple **Employee Management example**, where employee details are stored, converted into a byte stream, and later restored back into objects.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts applied.  
- Serialization and deserialization of employee objects.  
- Clean and minimal code with meaningful class and method names.  
- Output comparison between original and deserialized objects.  

## Technology Used
- Java (JDK 21 recommended)  
- Git/GitHub for version control  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lokeshgarg52/EmployeeSerialization.git
